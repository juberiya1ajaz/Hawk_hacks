# R3hab the Refugee

## 📌My pilgrim ancestors were refugees, were yours?

## 💡 Inspiration

We all remember Alan kurdi don't we? The first time that people all around the globe got to know about the refugee crisis. Right now we are also facing the Ukraine crisis. We focused on developing a feasible solution to tackle the Refugee crisis and safe philanthropy and educating people on it throughout the brainstorming process. On our website, you can donate money using blockchain. We wanted to develop a website with robust and transparent impact tracking and measurement systems that would help in reducing unnecessary costs, eliminating corruption, and boosting trustworthiness. This application was inspired by refugees and philanthropists worldwide who were unable to access optimal solutions.

## 💻 What it does

- Secure payment through Hedera
- User authentication using DeSo
- Multilang option making it user-friendly
- Map access from where you can find nearby Refugee helping centers and Refugee density.
- Chatbot for your assistance

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Node Js: For backend
- Hedera: For secure chatroom through the Hedera’s testnet
- DeSo: For user authentication
- Tailwind CSS: For styling

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to make a secure chatroom. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## 🔗 Best Use of DeSo

We are using DeSo to make a secure **user authentication**. DeSo is the first Layer 1 blockchain custom-built for decentralized social media applications.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Brainstorming: It took us a long time to develop a website that had a real societal influence.
- Some of our teammates were new To _MERN_ and _tailwind_ so it took a lot of time to get familiar with this tech stack.
- Working with Hedera and Deso, which we were unfamiliar with, working with databases, managing our scope such that we delivered a genuine product
- Utilizing the backend, we got it all to work in the end.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are grateful that we managed our time to complete the task swiftly and on time.
- Building a secure payment method using Hedera's testnet.
- Some of our teammates learned the bare bones of MERN and tailwind in such a short duration.

## 📖 What we learned

- Efficient use of GitHub actions.
- Collaboration with other developers.
- Using Hedera for secure payments through blockchain.
