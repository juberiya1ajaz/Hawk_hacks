On our website, you can donate money using blockchain. We wanted to develop a website with robust and transparent impact tracking and measurement systems that would help in reducing unnecessary costs, eliminating corruption, and boosting trustworthiness. This application was inspired by refugees and philanthropists worldwide who were unable to access optimal solutions.",
