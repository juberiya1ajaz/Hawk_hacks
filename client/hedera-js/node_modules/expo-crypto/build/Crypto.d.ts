/**
 * The `digestStringAsync()` method of `Crypto` generates a digest of the supplied `data` string with the provided digest `algorithm`.
 * A digest is a short fixed-length value derived from some variable-length input. **Cryptographic digests** should exhibit _collision-resistance_,
 * meaning that it's very difficult to generate multiple inputs that have equal digest values.
 * You can specify the returned string format as one of `CryptoEncoding`. By default, the resolved value will be formatted as a `HEX` string.
 * On web, this method can only be called from a secure origin (https) otherwise an error will be thrown.
 *
 * @param algorithm The cryptographic hash function to use to transform a block of data into a fixed-size output.
 * @param data The value that will be used to generate a digest.
 * @param options Format of the digest string. Defaults to: `CryptoDigestOptions.HEX`.
 * @return Return a Promise which fulfills with a value representing the hashed input.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const digest = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(
 *   Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA512,
 *   'ðŸ¥“ Easy to Digest! ðŸ’™'
 * );
 * ```
